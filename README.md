# Love Value Assessment
This tool can help you calculate your probability of winning in love.
## Principle
Enter the number of girls and set it to G.  
Enter the number of boys and set it to B.  
Probability S = ((1/(B+1))\*(1/G)+(1/(G+1))\*(1/B)) / 2  
That is, in a (B+G) individual, you have a probability of S(...%) liking someone and the other person also likes you.
